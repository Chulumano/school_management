# School Management System

Improvements to Solution and UML:
We believe that the choice of data types, such as Name, Address and City, made things a bit more complicated for the group. We think it was unnecessary that it was left that way and maybe could have left it as strings, it did make it harder for us while coding. 
Primary or composite keys needed to added to some of the entities
We also suggest that Country can be included into City, we didnâ€™t feel it was necessary to have its own entity. It would have worked fine in the City entity.
The entity attributes were written as Public (+) where as they needed to be represented as private (-) attributes.
The name entity should have not been included as it shows interaction however there is no direct interaction in the system implementation.
